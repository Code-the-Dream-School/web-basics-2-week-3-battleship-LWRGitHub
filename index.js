//All right we have been learning a lot of things. Now it is time to create something fun. Do you know the game battleship? Yes? well, we are going to create something similar.
//Battleship is a war-themed game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of their opponent's warships and sink them.
//Players take turns calling out row (x) and column (y), those are coordinates (x,y) identify a cell that contains a ship.
// As we are creating our own version, all of our ships are located in random cells of the gameBoard (each one in a cell). To make this possible you need to initialized the player's gameBoard (4x4) with zeros and to create the random positions of the warships
// 4 different coordinates x and y (one random number for 'x' between 0-3, one random number for 'y' between 0-3) need to be generated to indicate that there is going to be a ship and it is representated by a number 1 in the gameboard.
//On each turn, the player has to enter two numbers that identify a row (x) and column (Y) of the opponent target grid. if the coordinate "hit" a ship (find a number 1 in the gameBoard) the opponent has one less ship and an alert should be shown saying "you hit a warship"
//the winner is the first player that eliminates all the four ships of the oponent (ships=0)
//In order to store data we want you to:
//create two Players objects (one for each player). The Player object has the following properties: name (ask to the users) {string}, ships {number} (we are goin to play with 4) and gameBoard {number} (matrix 4x4) initialized with zeros
//so in general the game is a loop that takes a player turn and asks for the cordinates for the oponent's ships. loop is over when one of the players has 0 ships.
//return value contains a string with the winner name
